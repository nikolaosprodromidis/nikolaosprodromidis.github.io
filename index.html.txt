                <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, and my research focuses on topics at the intersection of health and labor economics.</p>
                <p>In my dissertation, I analyze significant historical events from the early welfare state in Sweden, including the reform establishing the 8-hour workday, major labor strikes, and the expansion of the healthcare sector, along with their consequences. Using early 20th-century Sweden as a case study, I combine high-quality administrative data with quasi-experimental econometric methods to address policy-relevant questions.</p>

        <p><strong>Strikes, Social Contacts, and Pandemics</strong><br>
        <em>Abstract:</em> This study explores how labor market activities, particularly labor strikes, influence disease transmission during pandemics by altering social interactions. Focusing on the 1918-1920 Great Influenza Pandemic in Sweden, the research investigates whether labor strikes, which increased social contacts, contributed to influenza-related mortality. I exploit staggered exogenous variation in strike timing produced by the expiration dates of collective agreements. Using 389,000 individual-level cause-of-death data and a local-projections staggered difference-in-differences framework, the study compares parishes with and without strikes during the pandemic to analyze their impact on mortality. The results reveal a 30% increase in influenza mortality rates in parishes with strikes, with notable variations across occupations. Specifically, mortality rates rose by 34% among workers and 25% among their families, while no significant effect was found in other professions. The study further examines the mechanisms behind these findings, suggesting that increased indoor worker meetings during strikes exacerbated disease spread. Using a Synthetic Difference-in-Differences approach, the research provides evidence that public gathering bans during strikes had unintended consequences, prompting workers to move their meetings indoors, where the risk of transmission was higher. These findings offer crucial insights for pandemic preparedness, emphasizing the role of labor market dynamics in shaping disease transmission.</p>
